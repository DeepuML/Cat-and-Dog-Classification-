---

A clean, practical deep learning project that classifies images as cat or dog using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras, depending on your code).

---

<h2 align="center">📌 Project Overview</h2>

This project trains a deep learning model to distinguish between cat and dog images. It can be used for:

- Practicing image classification pipeline end-to-end.
- Understanding CNNs and transfer learning.
- Experimenting with data augmentation and overfitting control.
- Deployment of image classifiers for practical apps.

---

<h2 align="center">🚀 Features</h2>

✅ Clean data loading and preprocessing  
✅ CNN or transfer learning model (e.g., ResNet, VGG)  
✅ Training and validation with accuracy/loss tracking  
✅ Confusion matrix and sample predictions visualization  
✅ Inference on new images  
✅ (Optional) Streamlit or Flask deployment for real-time predictions

<h2 align="center">🗂️ Dataset</h2>

We use the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats):

- Contains 25,000 labeled images (cat/dog).
- Images vary in size, requiring resizing during preprocessing.

<h2 align="center">🛠️ Installation</h2>

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Cat-Dog-Classification.git
cd Cat-Dog-Classification

2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\\Scripts\\activate

<h2 align="center">🧠 Future Improvements</h2>
Use advanced augmentations with albumentations.

Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.

Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces.

Export model to ONNX/TFLite for mobile inference.

Extend to multi-class pet breed classification.
